# AudioMix

AudioMix is a music player made using the C++ [JUCE framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE). This music player allows loading and playing of tracks, with the ability to adjust the speed, volume, and position of the loaded track. Tracks added into the *playlist* section are saved upon exiting the application, and restored when the application is reopened. Some other functionalities include crossfading between two tracks, searching for a track in the playlist, and the ability to add tracks to queue.

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/jxne00/AudioMix.git`.
